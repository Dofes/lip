# Frequent Asked Questions

## Where can I find online available teeth?

Visit [lipWeb](https://www.lippkg.com).

## It downloads so slowly! What can I do?

lip downloads teeth via GOPROXY. You can set the `GOPROXY` environment variable to a list of GOPROXY servers seperated by commas, e.g. `LIP_GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,https://goproxy.io`. Set a GOPROXY server that is close to you.

## It always shows errors when I try to install a tooth!

Probably the cache is corrupted. Try to purge the cache by running `lip cache purge`.

## How can I update lip?

Remove the current lip executable and install the latest version.
